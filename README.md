# sfml-game
# Primarily an attempt at developing a game physics engine that allows the user to implement entity's, manage collisions and handle advanced user inputs in a cartoonish physics simulation.
# Focus on testing algorithms that increase efficiency and reduce overhead. Managing memory efficiency is vital in the project while handling many calculations and alogirthms for a huge number of entity objects that do not despawn
# Reviewed mathematical capabilities, dealing with life-like physics with a cartoon twist, specifically gravity, air resistence, friction as well as angles based on velocity, forces and entity to entity collisions (e.g. arrow hitting another arrow mid-air)
# Included a lot of user input mechanics with the player's usability in mind.
# The focus on front end is a lot smaller compared to my focus on backp-end development.
